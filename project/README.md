# Instructions
## Task 1. code that prepares the dataset 
 use the prepare() function in project.utils.py
 specify the split, size, and directory to split files and image files by changing the params




## 2. code for training - the code should report a validation set accuracy at least once every epoch. epoch means here: when you are one time through all your training images.
3. code for A. predicting on all the test set images of at least one split without a GUI and B. reporting the accuracy on the test set images. note: test set, not validation set. You use the validation set during training.
4. code for running a GUI that allows a user to select one image of the test set, runs a prediction on it, and shows the result. https: //wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming – appJar seems to be the simplest, but use whatever you like, kivy seems to be a gui for games and cefpython to be the HTML5-est framework.
You should submit additionally a pdf document describing • who is in your team
